FAQ

What's Firepot Finance?
Firepot Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to make DeFi accessible and user-friendly for everyone. It offers the Firepot app, an innovative platform that integrates omnichain functionality, robo-advisory services, and comprehensive automation to provide a frictionless DeFi experience.

What's the mission of Firepot Finance?
The mission of Firepot Finance is to revolutionize the DeFi landscape by overcoming barriers and complexities associated with current DeFi solutions. We aim to make DeFi accessible for all users by providing a user-friendly platform that simplifies asset management, and investment decisions and maximizes returns in the DeFi ecosystem.

What makes Firepot Finance a game-changer in DeFi?
Firepot bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3 by combining the utility and simplicity of centralized exchanges with the security and control of non-custodial solutions. The Firepot app integrates emerging blockchains, robo-advisory services with new data sources and analysis techniques, and advanced automation capabilities like machine learning and AI-driven algorithms.

What are the key features of Firepot? How do they function?
We like to say three things. Unify - Discover - Automate. You access multiple chains from a single place and a single wallet.
You can discover yield farms, liquidity pools, staking, and lending opportunities on various chains and platforms. We aggregate these opportunities rather than creating them ourselves. We also simplify the process by making it a one-touch action to enter a farm, for example, without needing to go through multiple steps. Additionally, we can automate transactions between various chains and their native assets. Suppose you receive your salary on the Polygon network. You can set up a program to dollar-cost average (DCA) into native BTC and ETH, with the remaining amount going into a USDT savings account, for example.

What does comprehensive automation mean?
Comprehensive automation in Firepot enables users to automate their movement between yield farms, automate investments into preferred assets, and automate the division of income into separate accounts for investments, savings, and spending. This feature reduces manual effort and streamlines asset management.

How does the robo-advisory feature work?
The robo-advisory feature in Firepot utilizes on-chain and off-chain data, such as market insights and social listening, to rank assets and determine associated risks. Users can define their risk appetite and financial goals, and the platform recommends personalized investment strategies to help achieve those goals.

What is your long-term vision for the industry that Firepot Finance is working in?
Our long-term vision is not only the self-custody of tokens but the self-custody of data online. This transforms how we interact on the Internet. Instead of us signing into apps, apps sign into our wallets and we maintain control.
Web3 is all about removing intermediaries, being decentralized, and the technological revolution created by doing so! True Web3 is decentralized, everything else is just Web2.
