## DeFi for Degens. Crypto for Your Mom.


**Meet Ember: Your Personal Crypto Hub on Telegram and Beyond.**
_Intelligent – Seamless – Safe_


# What is Ember?

Manage all your assets, trades, yield positions, and wallets in one intuitive place with an expert advisor by your side every step of the way. The Ember AI is powered by a cutting-edge cognitive computing architecture, integrating an LLM reasoning engine and multi-agent system for autonomous decision-making.

This positions Ember as a dynamic assistant that adapts to meet your unique demands of crypto trading and DeFi management without the underlying complexity. Ember also brings hardware wallet security everywhere – allowing you to safely transact through Telegram, Discord, web, mobile, or even text and email.
