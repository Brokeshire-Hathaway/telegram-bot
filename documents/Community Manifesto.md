# Introduction
Firepot exists at the crossroads of innovation, necessity, and ambition. We envision a world where decentralized finance is not a utopia but the standard, accessible to all regardless of technical savvy. With Web2 users in mind, we're working relentlessly to dismantle the barriers standing in the way of mass DeFi adoption, starting with the most daunting - User Experience (UX).

# Our Beliefs and Values
In a rapidly digitalizing world, we recognize that our digital rights are increasingly inseparable from our fundamental human rights. Thus, we vehemently stand against the monopolization of financial tools and data by centralized entities. We believe in fostering a decentralized, inclusive, and secure financial ecosystem that empowers every user with full control and ownership of their assets and data. In this new frontier, we pledge never to compromise on the principles of autonomy, privacy, equity, and adaptability.

# Pillars of Digital Rights
1. **Digital Autonomy**
Freedom, they say, is nothing but a chance to be better. At Firepot, we equate digital autonomy to freedom. Freedom to express yourself, to control and custody your assets, and to access any protocol or mechanism without discrimination. We believe in the power of an empowered individual and aim to cultivate a community that upholds the ideals of self-governance and permissionless innovation.

2. **Digital Privacy and Security**
In the digital realm, privacy and security form the bedrock of user trust. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring robust security measures that protect you against malicious entities. From secure digital ownership to equal and protected access, our focus is on shielding your digital life with uncompromising vigilance.

3. **Digital Equity**
We envision a future where decentralization dismantles the concentration of power and wealth. Wherein the system's responsiveness and anti-fragility ensure that no small minority can control or manipulate it. We strive to cultivate a digital ecosystem that not only acknowledges but actively works to prevent wealth and power disparity.

4. **Digital Ownership**
Decentralization should not stop at access and control. It should extend to ownership, thereby eliminating vulnerabilities inherent in centralized systems. At Firepot, we advocate for self-custody, thereby granting individuals ultimate control over their digital assets. Furthermore, we recognize the right to be forgotten and the necessity for data portability. As custodians of your own digital destiny, we believe you should hold the reins.

5. **Homeostatic Diversity and Adaptability**
As we foster a vibrant and diverse community, we also recognize the critical role of adaptability. Technology is an ever-evolving entity, and our digital rights framework should evolve with it. By ensuring maximized homeostatic diversity, we aim to strike a balance between diverse forces in our ecosystem while maintaining stability. Through continuous adaptation, we strive to meet the changing demands of our community and the digital world at large.

# Our Pledge
At Firepot, we pledge to persist in our quest to make DeFi accessible to all, to uphold your digital rights, and to continuously adapt in line with evolving technology. We understand that building a community isn't about pushing a product; it's about sharing a vision and igniting a revolution. With this manifesto, we declare our commitment to you, our commitment to the principles that guide us, and our commitment to a decentralized and equitable financial future.

Our mission, our passion, our fight is against a system that excludes, exploits, and controls. Firepot is more than a tool; it's a movement. A movement that seeks to break down barriers, to democratize finance, and to put the power back in your hands. Because we believe, that when we're all given a fair shot, we don't just succeed, we thrive.

# Reviving Satoshi’s Vision
Just weeks after the 2008 Financial Crisis was caused by reckless centralized institutions, Satoshi Nakamoto released a whitepaper on October 31st, 2008. A decentralized peer-to-peer payments system was born, Bitcoin. For the very first time in history, a centralized institution could be replaced by decentralized rules written in computer code, removing the need for an intermediary third-party. Today, centralized finance (CeFi) platforms such as Binance transact 20 times more crypto token volume than their DeFi counterparts. This directly violates the problem that Satoshi set out to solve. Removing the risk of a centralized intermediary. Unfortunately, just over a decade after the financial crisis, we’ve once again witnessed neglegence and fraud with billions of dollars of customer funds lost from the insolvency of Celcius, FTX and dozens of other CeFi platforms. It’s time to revive Satoshi’s vision to give people direct control and ownership of their money instead of trusting third-parties. This is exactly what Firepot Finance gives you the tools to do.

_“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.” – Satoshi Nakamoto_

## What Is True DeFi?
True DeFi gives you full custody of your assets and data, granting you digital liberty and a fully personalized application experience.
Many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms offer custodial or semi-custodial wallets that connect to a limited number of DeFi platforms and services. However, they are still in full control of your assets and access. We’ve all seen the consequences of entrusting opaque institutions.

## Web3 - Does It Matter?
Web3 establishes “trustless” verification on the Internet, enabling ownership and authenticity without centralized institutions. Smart contracts and NFTs produce trust in execution and data authenticity respectively. This empowers the people, launching a new stage in evolution following the transformative impact of the Internet, computing, transportation, electricity, printing press, agriculture, language, fire and tools.

## Beyond Tokens
The most obvious impact of Web3 is the creation and ownership of novel tokens. However, one of the most important consequences of Web3 is the accessibility of data liberated through self-custody. The decentralized nature of Web3 creates a new paradigm shift in the way data is accessed and consumed. This moves the ownership of personal data away from corporations and back to the person it belongs, turning all remaining data on the Internet into a public good.

_Decentralized self-custody unlocks a new technological revolution called Web3._

## True Web3
When data is no longer fragmented and locked behind silos, it becomes a global genome on the blockchain that allows unprecedented expressibility for all people.

This metamorphosis may only occur through decentralized self-custody. Otherwise, the very nature of centralized silos will continue blocking these revolutionary innovations from being truly realized.

_True Web3 is decentralized. Everything else is just Web2._

## Web2 and CeFi
Some frustrating consequences of centralized data silos that we can all vividly understand are the dozens of messaging apps, or the hundreds of logins among various apps and services. Personal data is controlled and restricted in silos, owned and monetized by corporations.

## Web3 and DeFi
Through open and standardized data access provided by NFTs, all online messages are owned and shared between various messaging apps. You choose a single messaging app personalized to your needs from your teleporting profile on your universal account, accessed by your single Web3 wallet. Someone else can choose a different messaging app with all messages shared between the entire messaging app ecosystem.

# Conclusion
With hearts aflame and eyes set on the horizon, we invite you to join us on this extraordinary journey. As we navigate the uncharted terrains of DeFi and web3, let us build a community that embodies our shared values of autonomy, privacy, equity, and adaptability. Together, let's shape a future where technology liberates rather than restricts, where the digital realm is a playground for all, not a playground for the few. Let's ignite the fire, with Firepot.
