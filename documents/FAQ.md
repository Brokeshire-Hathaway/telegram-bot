## Investing
**Should I invest in Firepot/Ember?**
Conducting your own research and making an informed decision is essential. We are confident, however, that Ember stands out as the market's most advanced yet user-friendly crypto solution. Our goal is for Ember to be recognized not only as the most intelligent, streamlined, and safe crypto hub available but also as a true embodiment of the DeFi principles of self-custody, decentralization, and permissionless access.

**Should I invest in 'x' token or project?**
While Ember can provide you with information, educational resources, and suggestions, you should always do your own research (DYOR) and never invest more than they can afford to lose.

## DeFi Education
**What happens if I lose my seed phrase? Can I recover my assets?**
In DeFi, one of the most significant risks is the loss of your seed phrase, which can lead to permanent loss of all assets. Without a backup, asset recovery is impossible. Ember addresses this challenge by eliminating the need to manage a seed phrase. It integrates a multi-factor authentication system, similar to those used by banks but managed entirely on-chain, enhancing both security and convenience. Ember combines the robustness of a hardware wallet with the ease of biometric authentication, backed by multiple recovery options for added safety. Our collaboration with Odsy has enabled us to incorporate their advanced network, which uses zero-knowledge proofs for decentralized access control, ensuring the safekeeping of your assets.
