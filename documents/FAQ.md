## DeFi Education
**What happens if I lose my seed phrase? Can I recover my assets?**
In DeFi, one of the most significant risks is the loss of your seed phrase, which can lead to permanent loss of all assets. Without a backup, asset recovery is impossible. Ember addresses this challenge by eliminating the need to manage a seed phrase. It integrates a multi-factor authentication system, similar to those used by banks but managed entirely on-chain, enhancing both security and convenience. Ember combines the robustness of a hardware wallet with the ease of biometric authentication, backed by multiple recovery options for added safety. Our collaboration with Odsy has enabled us to incorporate their advanced network, which uses zero-knowledge proofs for decentralized access control, ensuring the safekeeping of your assets.
